This project was created for the purpose of experimentation and an attempt to use what I've learned for my own fun and curiosity. The project was extremely fun and 
allowed me to gain experience in applying my knowledge in something realistic. Pygame is an extremely interesting and a great tool that helped me to create this. In
class, we focused a lot on object oriented programming, and I was able to apply this to my own project.
